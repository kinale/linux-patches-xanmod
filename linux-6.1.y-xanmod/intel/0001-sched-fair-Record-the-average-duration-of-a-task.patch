Subject: [PATCH 01/21] sched/fair: Record the average duration of a task

Record the average duration of a task, as there is a requirement
to leverage this information for better task placement.

At first thought the (p->se.sum_exec_runtime / p->nvcsw)
can be used to measure the task duration. However, the
history long past was factored too heavily in such a formula.
Ideally, the old activity should decay and not affect
the current status too much.

Although something based on PELT can be used, se.util_avg might
not be appropriate to describe the task duration:
Task p1 and task p2 are doing frequent ping-pong scheduling on
one CPU, both p1 and p2 have a short duration, but the util_avg
can be up to 50%, which is inconsistent with task duration.

It was found that there was once a similar feature to track the
duration of a task:
commit ad4b78bbcbab ("sched: Add new wakeup preemption mode: WAKEUP_RUNNING")
Unfortunately, it was reverted because it was an experiment. Pick the
patch up again, by recording the average duration when a task voluntarily
switches out.

For example, suppose on CPU1, task p1 and p2 run alternatively:

 --------------------> time

 | p1 runs 1ms | p2 preempt p1 | p1 switch in, runs 0.5ms and blocks |
               ^               ^                                     ^
 |_____________|               |_____________________________________|
                                                                     ^
                                                                     |
                                                                  p1 dequeued

p1's duration in one section is (1 + 0.5)ms. Because if p2 does not
preempt p1, p1 can run 1.5ms. This reflects the nature of a task:
how long it wishes to run at most.
